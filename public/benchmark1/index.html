    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>This document describes a game called “Farm Defense”, which is designed to be a simple 2D top-down game. The game will use sprite-based animation, characters, tiled, backgrounds, collision detection, AI, search algorithm and showing memory management.</p>

    <h2>TECHNOLOGY</h2>
    <p>For our technology, the game “Farm Defense” will be developed for the Windows Platform using the Wofile 2D engine, which is the basic game engine made by Stony Brook University.</p>

    <h2>BACK STORY</h2>
    <p>One day, strange occurrences began happening around a peaceful village, accompanied by unusual sounds emanating from the forest behind it. New, unidentified types of insects emerged, ravaging crops and decimating farms without warning. These insects seemed to possess a mysterious energy, becoming even larger and more menacing under the moonlight. At this time, Kevin decided to transform the harvested crops into defense towers to protect the village. Will Kevin be able to hold the fate of the village and safeguard his farm from these unknown insects?</p>
